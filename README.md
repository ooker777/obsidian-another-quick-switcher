This is an Obsidian plugin which is another choice of Quick switcher.

- It can create custom search commands (`Custom searches`)
- It can search backlinks and move them **without leaving from a keyboard** (`Backlink search`)
- It can move a file to another folder (`Move file to another folder`)
- It can search **regardless of the appearance order of tokens**
- It **only searches Markdown files** except for the case of `Move file to another folder`
- It does not search very fuzzy (e.g. searching for `201` doesn't match `2.01`) 
- It can search to **consider prefix emoji**
- It shows file names and directory names separately

| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Perfect word match | A query matches perfectly with a word in the filename |
| Prefix name match  | The filename starts with a query                      |
| Name match         | The filename includes a query                         |
| Tag match          | The tag name in the file includes a query             |
| Header match       | The header name in the file includes a query          |
| Link match         | The internal link name in the file includes a query   |
| Length             | Length of the filename                                |
| Last opened        | The time the file opened last                         |

### 2‚Äç‚É£ Backlink search

![Demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tadashi-aikawa/obsidian-another-quick-switcher/master/demo/backlink-search.gif)

### 3‚Äç‚É£ Header floating search in file / Header search in file

![Demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tadashi-aikawa/obsidian-another-quick-switcher/master/demo/header-floating-search-in-file.gif)

- Show all headers even after filtering to retain file structures in the brain
- Jump to the first hit suggestion automatically and move next/previous by `Tab/Shift+Tab` as default

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Grep

This feature requires [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) that can call from anywhere. In other words, the `rg --version` command must be in a state to succeed everywhere.

![Demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tadashi-aikawa/obsidian-another-quick-switcher/master/demo/grep.gif)

- `TAB`: Search (not realtime)
- `Ctrl+,`: preview
- Input regards as a regex pattern
- Because ripgrep search just fastly when you need to search, **it needs no indexes and caches, of course, no need to create them before!** ‚ú®
